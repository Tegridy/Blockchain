# About
Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed. Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology. In this project, you will try yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain. As difficult as the project might be, it is bound to pay off: not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and skills.

# Learning outcomes
Get a profound understanding of how blockchains work, apply your hashing and multithreading skills and learn about (de)serialization.
